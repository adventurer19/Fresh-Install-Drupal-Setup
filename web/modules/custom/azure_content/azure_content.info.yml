#  Modules have the ability to provide dynamic library definitions and alter libraries.
#  A module can use the hook_library_info() hook to provide a library definition.
#  This is not the recommended way to define a library, but it is provided for edge use cases.
#libraries:
#  Modules do not have the ability to use libraries-override or libraries-extend,
#  and need to rely on the hook_library_info_alter() hook.
