In the context of testing the permissions
for different orles in a web application particularly 
for content management, the most suitable type of test for minimizing
resource would be a Unit Test
Here's a brief explamation of each type
Kernle test
Kernel test in drupal typically focus on testing the
interaction with the underlying drupal system, including services, events, and other low-level component
While important for certan aspects of drupal development, kernel tests might not be
the most efficient coice for testing role-based permissions on content types.
Unit test 
Unit tests are designed to test individual components
or functions in isolation, without involving the broader context of a running web application.
They are well-suited for testing specific functions or methos responsible for 
handleing permising, ensuring that each unit of code workds correctly.
Functional test
functions test involve testing the application as a whole,
sumulating user interaction with the system.
While functional tests can be valuable for testing user roles and permissions , they 
generally more reouser-ceintensive compared to unit tests

FunctionalJavascript tests
Functional javascript test are similar to functional test but specifically
focus on teseting the javasciprt behavior of your application
These test are not directly related to testing service-side role-base permissions.
For testing that each role has the proper set of permissions for a specific content
type, creating unit tests that focus on the specific permissions-checking logic would be more 
efficing and resource-friendly.Unit tests allow you to isolete and verify the behavior of indiviudal functions
or methods responsible for handling permissions.
